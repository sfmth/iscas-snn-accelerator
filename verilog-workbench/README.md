<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project aims to ease the setup of your verilog projects by providing you with a precoded workbench.

### Built With

* `Icarus Verilog (iverilog)` To simulate your verilog code
* `Cocotb` To verify your verilog code by writing python testbenches
* `GTKWave` To view the input or outpot waveforms of your design 
* `Yosys` To synthesize your design into actual hardware and view it



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

For the project to work you would have to install these things first:

* [Icarus Verilog](https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html)
* [Cocotb](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/install.html)
* [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)
* [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/download.html)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sfmth/verilog-workbench/ && cd verilog-workbench
   ```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
To run a simulation, first you would have to write your verilog code and testbench. You can put your Verilog code in `verilog-workbench/src/` and your test bench in `verilog-workbench/`.

Then, in order to run the simulation you can do:
```sh
make && make gtkwave
```

To delete all the simulation files generated by `make`:
```sh
make delete
```
And if you want to see your synthesized design you can do:
```sh
make show_synth
```
