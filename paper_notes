neurons
for neuromorphic models LIF neurons give us a good approximation of real neurons that has low computational complexity. (neural engineering book)

other sram accesses can be parralelized with the w sram.

+u_b_processor
* zero potentials after spike
* multiply potentials and beta as they are loading

+spk_processor
* input spike cache
* schmitt_trigger functionality

+neuron_selector
* output potential selector
* input potential selector
